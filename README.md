# WEEK ONE CODE CHALLENGE
#### About
First code challenge under phase 1 to test my understanding of the various important javascript concepts

## Description
This code challenge tests my undertanding of the javascript functions and conditional statements. It is madeup of three files which should answer the following questions:

1. Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

2. Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

3. Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.  NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
